(4) Upon taking property specified in subsection 2 into personal use (either during engagement in business or in the case of termination of engagement in business), the market price of the property is included in the taxpayer’s business income. Upon any future transfer of such property, the amount which pursuant to this subsection is added to business income is deemed to be the acquisition cost of the property.

(5) Upon taking property specified in subsection 3 into personal use (either during engagement in business or in the case of termination of engagement in business), the market price of the property minus the difference between the acquisition cost and the depreciation of fixed assets is included in the taxpayer’s business income. Upon any future transfer of such property, the amount which pursuant to this subsection is added to business income is deemed to be the acquisition cost of the property.

(6) If the activities of a sole proprietor are suspended pursuant to the provisions of the Commercial Code and the activities of a notary and bailiff are suspended pursuant to the provisions of the Taxation Act for longer than twelve months, the assets specified in subsections 2 and 3 of this section are deemed to have been taken into personal use.

2) the loan is used to finance long-term infrastructure projects of public sector involving both the project promoter, borrowing costs, assets and income in the European Union, or
3) a resident company that is a member of a consolidated group for financial accounting purposes shall choose to apply subsection 8.

(2) The residual borrowing cost is the amount by which the deductible borrowing costs of a resident company exceed interest income and other taxable income which is economically equal. For the purposes of this Act, borrowing costs are deemed to be interest expenses of any debt obligation and other costs that are economically equivalent to interest and expenses incurred in raising funds, including:
1) payments on profit-sharing loans;
2) estimated interest accrued on convertible bonds and zero coupon bonds;
3) amounts received under alternative financing arrangements;

9) guarantee fees for financing agreements, management fees and similar costs related to borrowing of funds.

(7) Profit before depreciation is calculated by adding the amounts adjusted for taxation purposes to the taxable amount of the excess borrowing costs of taxable income and the adjusted depreciation and amortization amounts for taxation purposes. If there are no amounts adjusted for tax purposes, the accounting amounts shall be based on. Pre-depreciation profit is excluding:
1) income exempt from income tax, including income on account of which the distributed profit is not taxed;
2) all the proceeds from the loan used to finance the entire long-term infrastructure project of public sector.

(8) A resident company that is a member of a consolidated group for financial accounting purposes may choose that its excess borrowing cost is not taxed if it demonstrates that its equity to total assets ratio is equal to or greater than that of the group, except the ratio of financial undertakings belonging to the group, owner’s equity and total assets and if the following conditions are met:

(9) A resident company that is a member of a consolidated group for financial accounting purposes may rely on a ceiling on excess borrowing costs higher than that provided for in subsection 1. The higher residual borrowing cost limit is calculated in two stages:
1) the ratio is calculated by dividing the borrowing costs of the group incurred relating to third parties, with the exception of the financial undertakings of the group and the borrowing costs specified in clause 2 of subsection 1, by the pre-depreciation profit of the group, excluding financial undertakings belonging to the group;
2) the ratio obtained is multiplied by the pre-depreciation profit of the resident company.

(10) If the residual borrowing costs of a resident company remain below the limit provided for in this section during the taxation period, the resident company shall be entitled to make the income tax recalculation on the income tax paid on the loan borrowing costs in excess in the preceding tax periods up to the limit provided for in this section and demand repayment of the overpaid income tax. The recalculations shall be made in the declaration specified in § 54^4 . The overpaid income tax shall be refunded pursuant to the procedure provided for in the Taxation Act.

§ 54^6. Definitions used in this Chapter

() [RT I, 23.12.2019, 2 – entry into force 01.01.2020]

(1) Mismatch outcome is a situation where:
1) it is allowed, upon calculation of the tax liability, to include the same payment, expenses or losses (hereinafter together expenses) in expenses in more than one jurisdiction;
2) it is allowed, upon calculation of the tax liability, to include the same payment or deemed payment (hereinafter together payment) in expenses in the jurisdiction where that payment is treated as made, but, upon calculation of taxable profit, it is not included in income in the jurisdiction where the payment is treated as received.

(2) Mismatch in tax outcomes is a mismatch outcome that has arisen:
1) between a resident company and its affiliated company;
2) between a legal person and its permanent establishment;
3) between two or more permanent establishments of a non-resident legal person, one of which is located in Estonia;
4) as a result of a payment made to or by a hybrid entity; or
5) as a result of a tax scheme.

(3) Mismatch in tax outcomes is also a situation that arises if a payment made under a financial instrument gives rise to the mismatch outcome described in clause 2 of subsection 1 due to the fact that the jurisdictions have classified the financial instrument or a payment made under it differently and, upon calculation of profit, this payment is not included in income by the payee jurisdiction within a reasonable period of time. No mismatch in tax outcomes arises if the payment is made by a trader under an on-market hybrid transfer and, pursuant to the legislation of the payer jurisdiction, the trader treats all the income received from trading in the financial instruments as part of its taxable profit.

(4) A payment made under a financial instrument is included within a reasonable period of time for the purposes of subsection 3 if:
1) upon calculation of profit, the payment is included in income by the payee jurisdiction in the taxation period that commences within a period of 12 months of the end of the payer’s taxation period; or
2) it is reasonable to expect that, upon calculation of profit, the payment will be included in income by the payee jurisdiction the next taxation period, and the payment has been made under the arm’s length principle.

(5) The person or entity specified in subsection 5 of § 54^2  is treated as an affiliated company, taking into account the following specifications:

2) upon application of §§ 54^7  and 54^8 , a person who has a voting right in an entity or holds a participation in the capital of an entity together with another person shall be treated as also exercising the voting right held by the other person and holding a participation in the capital held by the other person;
3) upon application of §§ 54^7  and 54^8 , an affiliated company also means an entity that is part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes as the taxpayer, a company in which the taxpayer has a significant influence in the management as well as a company that has a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer.

(6) Payer jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the payment has its source or in which it is treated as made, in which the expenses are incurred or the losses are suffered. In the case of a payment made through or on account of a hybrid entity or permanent establishment, the payer jurisdiction is the jurisdiction where the hybrid entity or permanent establishment is established or situated.

(7) Head office or hybrid entity shareholder jurisdiction is the jurisdiction that allows, in addition to the payer jurisdiction, the inclusion of the expenses specified in clause 1 of subsection 1.

(8) Payee jurisdiction is the jurisdiction where the payment is received or where it is treated as being received under the legislation of another jurisdiction.

(9) Expenses deducted are the amount that is allowed to be included in expenses upon calculation of taxable profit in the payer or head office or hybrid entity shareholder jurisdiction.

(10) Income included is the amount that is taken into account as income upon calculation of taxable profit in the payee jurisdiction. A payment under a financial instrument shall not be treated as income included if the payment qualifies for any tax relief solely due to the way that payment is characterised in the payee jurisdiction.

(11) Tax relief means a tax exemption, reduction in the tax rate and right to reduction in tax liability or to tax refund. The right to include the income tax withheld in a foreign state shall not be treated as tax relief.

(12) Dual inclusion income is the income that is included upon taxation in more than one jurisdiction where the mismatch outcome has arisen.

(13) Hybrid entity is an entity that is regarded as a taxpayer in one jurisdiction, but whose income or expenditure is treated as income or expenditure of another person in another jurisdiction.

(14) Financial instrument is any security transferred in the course of a hybrid transfer the return or profit earned on which is taxed in the payer or payee jurisdiction as the income or profit derived from external capital, equity or derivatives.

(15) Trader is a person or entity engaged in business of regularly buying and selling financial instruments on its own account.

(16) Hybrid transfer is any transaction to transfer a financial instrument where the return derived from the financial instrument as a result of the transfer is treated for tax purposes as return derived simultaneously by more than one of the parties to that transaction.

(17) On-market hybrid transfer is any hybrid transfer that is entered into by a trader in the ordinary course of business, and not as part of a tax scheme.
